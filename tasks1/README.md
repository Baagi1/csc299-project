# Tasks4 - Task Summarization using OpenAI API

This project uses the OpenAI Chat Completions API (gpt-5-mini) to summarize
paragraph-length task descriptions into short phrases.

The Python code is complete and follows all assignment requirements. However,
I was not able to fully run and test the program because my OpenAI API
credits ran out and I currently have a billing issue. Once the billing is
resolved, the app will run successfully using:

    uv run tasks4

I included two example task descriptions in the code for testing.

API keys are not included in this repository for security reasons.
